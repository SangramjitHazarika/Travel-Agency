# Travel Agency
 
Front-end: - HTML5, CSS3, JS, jQuery, AJAX Back-end: - PHP Database: - MySQL (phpMyAdmin)

This project is a web based platform.

In this project we have used various types of languages including PHP, CSS, HTML etc. We have created the home page using HTML code which consists of the tabs including the About Us, Home and Login. We have created the branch page using HTML code under About Us tab. The user can get to know various types of transports by clicking on the Transports tab under Home tab. The Transport page is also being created using HTML code. In Transport page we have linked each and every airlines or Railways to their official sites. Then we have created the package page which will help tourists to suggest the best Travel Package along with various types of discounts for domestic and foreign trips.

So, basically firstly the user has to log in if he/she has an account previously. However if they are new to this website they have to create an account by going to the sign up page. After filling the required credentials the user will get a mail stating that he has become a member of this agency “Hiking Buddies” along with his username and password for proceeding further. We have created this using PHP and PHP Mailer. The user’s details will then be collected in a Database for future use. After signing in, the user has to login using their username and password.

We have created database almost for each and every page right from branch, signup, employee, package to insurance. We have also made use of session management which will create individual session id i.e. the user’s details will be carried forward throughout the particular session. After the final payment along with g-mail, we also receipt a transcript which includes the user’s travelling details.

So, finally we have created a project which will meet all the expectations of the user and the user can search for anything related to travel hassle free. One of the important things is that we have checked for all the validations wherever it is necessary throughout the project.
